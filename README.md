Run Build Scripts: Run build scripts or other development tasks.
Interact with Git: Perform Git commands such as git add, git commit, git push, etc.
Install Packages: Use package managers like npm or yarn to install dependencies (npm install, yarn install).
Debug Applications: Start and debug your applications using command-line tools or scripts.
Advantages of Using the Integrated Terminal:
Contextual Integration: The terminal operates within the same window as your code editor, allowing for seamless switching between editing and executing commands.

Direct Interaction with Files: You can directly interact with files and folders in your project without navigating to a separate directory in an external terminal.

Keyboard Shortcuts: VS Code provides shortcuts and integrations that make terminal usage faster and more efficient.

Customization: You can customize the terminal's appearance, behavior, and default shell according to your preferences in VS Code settings.

Extension Integration: Some extensions, such as those for languages or frameworks, may provide additional terminal commands or shortcuts that enhance your development workflow.

9. Debugging in VS Code:
   - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code? ANSWER : Setting Up and Starting Debugging:
Install Necessary Extensions (if required):

Make sure you have any necessary extensions installed for the programming language or framework you are working with. Many languages have dedicated debugging extensions available in the VS Code Marketplace.
Open Your Project:

Open your project folder in VS Code by selecting File > Open Folder... and navigating to your project directory.
Create or Open the Program File:

Create a new file or open an existing file containing the code you want to debug.
Add Breakpoints:

Click in the gutter (the area to the left of your code) at the line where you want to set a breakpoint. A red dot will appear, indicating a breakpoint is set.
Configure Launch Configuration:

VS Code uses launch configurations (stored in .vscode/launch.json) to specify how your program should be debugged.
If a launch.json file doesn't exist, VS Code will prompt you to create one when you try to start debugging for the first time.
You can manually configure launch.json by clicking on the debug icon (🐞) in the Activity Bar, then selecting Add Configuration....
Select Debugging Environment:

Choose the environment or runtime you want to debug (e.g., Node.js, Python, .NET Core, etc.). VS Code provides pre-configured templates for popular environments.

Click on the green play button (Start Debugging) in the debug toolbar, or press F5.
Alternatively, you can choose a specific configuration from the dropdown menu next to the play button.
Debugging Session:

VS Code will launch your program in the selected debugging environment and stop execution at the first breakpoint encountered.
The debug toolbar allows you to control program execution (pause, resume, step over, step into, step out), inspect variables, and interact with the debugging session

10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub. ANSWER : Initializing a Git Repository:
Open Your Project in VS Code:

Open the folder of your project in VS Code (File > Open Folder...).
Open the Source Control View:

Click on the Source Control icon (Ctrl+Shift+G or the icon that looks like a branch and a plus sign) in the Activity Bar on the left-hand side of VS Code.
Initialize Git Repository:

Click on the Initialize Repository button (looks like a Git logo with a plus sign) in the Source Control view.
Alternatively, you can open the integrated terminal (Ctrl+``) and run git init` command to initialize Git manually.
2. Making Commits:
Stage Changes:
In the Source Control view, you'll see a list of changes (new files, modified files).
Click on the + button next to each file or use the Stage All Changes button to stage all changes for the next commit.
Commit Changes:
Enter a commit message in the textbox provided in the Source Control view.
Click on the checkmark icon (Commit button) to commit the staged changes.
Optionally, you can also commit directly from the integrated terminal using git commit -m "Your commit message".
3. Pushing Changes to GitHub:
Set Up Remote Repository (if not already done):

Go to GitHub and create a new repository if you haven't already.
Copy the HTTPS or SSH URL of your remote repository.
Add Remote Repository:

In the integrated terminal (Ctrl+``), use the git remote add` command to add the remote repository:
HTTPS: git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git
SSH: git remote add origin git@github.com:username/repository.git
Push Commits:

After committing changes locally, push them to the remote repository (GitHub):
In the integrated terminal, use git push origin main (or git push origin master for older repositories where main is replaced with master).
Alternatively, you can push directly from the Source Control view by clicking on the ellipsis (...) next to your commit and selecting Push.
